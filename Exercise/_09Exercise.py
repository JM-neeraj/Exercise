# Prank
# The repeated portion in the program above (p6-2.py) can be run very quickly because the part that outputs to the terminal has been removed from the for-loop. Change the index of the range() function on line 6 from 10 to 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, and 10000000 to see how long it takes to run.




for i in range(10):
    print(i)

# for i in range(1000):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(100000):
#     print(i)

# for i in range(1000000):
#     print(i)

for i in range(10000000):
    print(i)


# while we inc. value inside range same as loop take long time to run.
